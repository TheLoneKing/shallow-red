# shallow-red

This is a chess bot that is built using node.js framework. It currently has one bot named [ShallowRedFish](https://lichess.org/@/ShallowRedFish) available on the [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/) platform. It also tweets at the start of each game that it plays. Check'em out by following [@ShallowRedFish](https://twitter.com/ShallowRedFish) on twitter. ShallowRedFish utilizes the Stockfish engine (depth = 10) to calculate the moves.

The bot itself is hosted on heroku.

# Contributions

Since this my first attempt at creating a chess bot as well as a node.js app, I'm aware that the app might have a lot of room for improvement. If you want to suggest an improvement, please submit a Pull Request; I'd greatly appreciate your effort.

# Acknowledgements

This app wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for the open-source community. There were already a ton of similar attempts which made it really simple for me to do this. I will link the projects  which I studied and took inspiration from below.
